# Title: Comparative-Model-performance-of-Text-Classification-task

# Description: 
This project deals with neural text classification using PyTorch. Text classification is the process of assigning tags or categories to text according to its content. It's one of the fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection. Here the News Article Classification is done into different genres using Linear Model, BidirectionalLSTM, and combined model using Dempster-Shafer Combination Rule

## Dataset used: 
AG_NEWS 

## How to run the project
* There are three jupyter files.
* Each file contains a classifer as per the name of the file.
* Open the file using google colab or VScode.
* Each file contains detailed clear description of each step performed and packages to install(if any)
